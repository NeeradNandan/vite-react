# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Description and Goals

This project utilizes [React-Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) and [React-Three-Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) for a simple 3D scene with 
a rotating cube and sparkles to showcase how simple it is to use React-three-fiber with Drei instead of ThreeJS.
